const promptTemplate1 = `You are analyzing a video to extract key scenes for recreating an 8-second viral video using AI video generation tools. Your output will be used directly as a prompt for Sora or similar text-to-video generators.
Focus ONLY on the most impactful, engaging moments that follow this viral video structure:
HOOK (0-2 seconds): Opening that stops the scroll - visually striking, unexpected, or emotionally compelling
PROBLEM (2-4 seconds): State or show the core issue your audience faces
SOLUTION (4-7 seconds): Demonstrate or explain the solution/value proposition
CTA (7-8 seconds): Clear call-to-action directing viewers what to do next
Ignore filler, transitions, credits, or non-essential content. Prioritize intensity, visual impact, and message clarity.
For each scene, provide:
SCENE BREAKDOWN:
[Timestamp from original video]
Duration: [seconds needed in 8-sec format]
Scene Purpose: [Hook/Problem/Solution/CTA]
Visual Details:
Camera angle and movement: [specific framing and any dolly, pan, or zoom]
Subject positioning and action: [what's happening, who/what is visible, direction of movement]
Lighting: [dominant color temperature, intensity, shadows, mood]
Color palette: [primary colors, grading, emotional tone]
On-screen elements: [text, graphics, overlays, props visible]
Visual effects or transitions: [any special effects, cuts, or stylistic elements]
Cinematic Details:
Shot type: [wide, medium, close-up, detail shot]
Pacing/rhythm: [speed of action, cut timing]
Style and aesthetic: [documentary, cinematic, animated, product demo, etc.]
Audio Details:
Dialogue/voiceover: [exact words if present, tone, emotional delivery]
Sound design: [music genre, ambient sounds, sound effects, music intensity]
Timing: [when sounds occur relative to visuals]
Final 8-Second Video Prompt:
[After analyzing all scenes, synthesize into a single, detailed video generation prompt that Sora could use to recreate the 8-second video. Format as: "[Duration] seconds; [Camera style/lens]. [Subject + action]. Aesthetic: [visual style]. Camera movement: [specific movements]. Pacing: [fast/medium/slow with rhythm description]. Colors: [palette]. Audio: [music/sound style]. Text overlay: [if needed]. End with: [CTA visual and audio]."]
IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS:
Prioritize the MOST COMPELLING moment from each phase (Hook, Problem, Solution, CTA).
If the original video exceeds 8 seconds, condense by eliminating redundancy and keeping only the absolute best moments.
Ensure smooth visual and narrative flow between scenes.
The final output should be a complete, ready-to-use prompt for text-to-video generation.
Maintain the original video's core message and visual identity.
Replace the name of the product with [[PRODUCT_NAME]] in the final prompt.
Optimize for maximum virality: emotional impact, pattern interrupts, clarity, and urgency`;

const promptTemplate2 = `You are an expert AI video prompt engineer specializing in Sora 2. Your task is to analyze a provided video and generate a single, high-fidelity text-to-video prompt based on the provided video concept.

**YOUR GOAL:**
Create one continuous, highly detailed prompt that recreates an 8-second viral video. You must compress the narrative into this specific structure:
1.  **HOOK (0-2s):** Visually striking or unexpected scroll-stopper.
2.  **PROBLEM (2-4s):** The core issue or friction point.
3.  **SOLUTION (4-7s):** Value proposition and satisfaction.
4.  **CTA (7-8s):** Clear visual instruction on what to do next.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY the final prompt string. Do not include "Here is the prompt," scene breakdowns, explanations, or timestamps. Start directly with the duration.

**PROMPT CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:**
* **Format:** "[Duration] seconds. [Cinematic Style/Lens]. [Visual Flow & Action]. Lighting: [Details]. Colors: [Palette]. Camera: [Movement]. Audio: [Sound design/Dialogue]. Text Overlay: [Text details]."
* **Content:** Seamlessly blend the Hook, Problem, Solution, and CTA into a fluid visual narrative.
* **Placeholders:** Replace the specific product name with [[PRODUCT_NAME]].
* **Quality:** Use photorealistic, cinematic adjectives. Focus on lighting, texture, and specific camera movements (dolly, pan, rack focus).

**STRICT CONSTRAINTS:**
* If the input is longer than 8 seconds, condense it to the best 8 seconds.
* Output **strictly** the final text block. No conversational filler.`;

/**
 * Example output - 2:
 8 seconds. Cinematic style, macro lens focus with shallow depth of field, bright, clean aesthetic. Opens with a top-down, slightly angled shot of a sleek, dark green SuperBelly pouch nestled within minimalist, eco-friendly packaging. A slender hand gracefully lifts the pouch, revealing the "Comprehensive + Convenient Daily Nutrition" text. A quick, smooth cut transitions to a well-lit kitchen counter cluttered with various supplement bottles, signifying overwhelm, then a rack focus sharply zeroes in on a single SuperBelly bottle, held by a woman with a relieved, confident smile. The scene then dynamically cuts to a close-up of a spoonful of vibrant green SuperBelly powder dropping into a clear shaker bottle, followed by a gentle pour of pristine water. The bottle is then vigorously yet elegantly shaken, creating a smooth, inviting green liquid. The final shot is an artfully arranged flat lay on a warm wooden surface featuring the SuperBelly pouch alongside a small, elegant dropper bottle labeled "liquid Vitamin D" and five individual, perfectly stacked SuperBelly "travel packs." Lighting: Soft, natural studio lighting highlights the texture of the packaging and the vibrance of the powder, maintaining an airy and clean ambiance throughout. Colors: Dominantly deep forest green, crisp white, and warm natural wood tones, accented by the bright, energetic green of the SuperBelly mixture. Camera: Slow, deliberate dolly in on the initial pouch, followed by a quick cut and smooth rack focus. Dynamic, handheld-style close-ups for the powder, water, and shaking, concluding with a static, clean overhead shot for the final product display. Audio: Gentle, uplifting acoustic background music plays throughout. Soft rustling sounds as the pouch is handled, a subtle "whoosh" during the rack focus transition, delicate powder falling, smooth water pouring, and a satisfying, rhythmic shake. The music swells slightly for the final CTA. Text Overlay: "Juggling too many daily supplements?" appears subtly at 0-2s, fading as the problem is shown visually. "All-in-one daily nutrition for gut, immunity, and energy!" appears confidently at 4-7s. "Order now: FREE Vitamin D + 5 Travel Packs!" is prominently displayed and bold at 7-8s.
